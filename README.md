The goal of this project is to be able to translate audio into sheet music.

The vision: 
Accessible to anyone with an account (this allows control to throttle or such in the future / ban misuse)
Upload audio samples which gets translated into respective musical notes.
Ultimately be able to separate out different instrument parts in an audio sample and generate sheet music separate for each.

Is this feasible? 
Dunno :) The human brain is able to distinguish different instrumental pieces in an audio sample -- generating covers around popular music. Machine learning is a field I have always been interested in and I wanted to use this project as a way to get into machine learning. How far this project goes depends on the research I conduct as I work on this project (I'm a dive-first and learn person!)
